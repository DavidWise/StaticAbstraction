Not sure how to test this as the whole point of this library is to create mockable variants of components that normally are not mockable


For now, I will simply call the underlying objects methods as best as I can - at least until a better method becomes apparent

Granted, most of this is merely direct calls to the wrapped object's methods so this isnt really 'testing' so much as making sure I didnt mix up methods when creating the library
